# Hearthstone Cards Filter
HCF is a simply cards filter for "Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft". You can filter cards by:

  - Card name
  - Classes
  - Mana cost
  - Types (Minion, Spell, Weapon, Hero, Hero power)
  - Rarity
  - Specs (Taunt, Battlecry, Divin Shield, Charge, Windfury)
  - Races

# Demo
You can view a demo [here](http://rtransat.github.io/hearthstone-cards-filter/)

# Database cards
I use those JSON files to get data cards: https://github.com/jamsyoung/hearthstone-api
Images are displayed from http://wow.zamimg.com/

# Development
The project is built with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) (it's the first time I use this technology, so the code is clearly not the best, there is no doubt that we can refactor it)

# Do you want help me to improve this project ?
Feel free to send your pull request to improve the code and functionality.

# Todo list
  - Display card with 7 mana AND more when we check "7"
  - Add pagination
  - Lazy loading images
  - Store checked filter in local storage
  - Build decks ?
  - **Refactor the code :)**
